    "So: I have a bunch of augmented images generated by Roboflow.  I'd like to use these to train a model so that, hopefully, it does a bit better than the original one I had.\n",
    "\n",
    "That original one was created using Detecto.  I came across [a bug in detecto](https://github.com/alankbi/detecto/issues/68) when displaying bounding boxes for these augmented images; while this might not affect the trainign it does, I had been meaning to move away from Detecto anyhow; it's a nice tool, but a black box that doesn't help me get familiar with PyTorch.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus...I think the thing to do here is to re-create Detecto's model using PyTorch directly, and with Roboflow's augmented dataset as the training set.\n",
