    "So: I have a bunch of augmented images generated by Roboflow.  I'd like to use these to train a model so that, hopefully, it does a bit better than the original one I had.\n",
    "\n",
    "That original one was created using Detecto.  I came across [a bug in detecto](https://github.com/alankbi/detecto/issues/68) when displaying bounding boxes for these augmented images; while this might not affect the training it does, I had been meaning to move away from Detecto anyhow; it's a nice tool, but a black box that doesn't help me get familiar with PyTorch.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus...I think the thing to do here is to re-create Detecto's model using PyTorch directly, and with Roboflow's augmented dataset as the training set.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's get started!"

    "## A minor update...\n",
    "\n",
    "After I wrote this, the bug in detecto was fixed with the release of version 1.2.1.  So that's good.\n",
    "\n",
    "But also, I wrote `src/pytorch/experiment.py` (poor choice of name, but here we are); it was my attempt to replicate Detecto using PyTorch, but without using Jupyter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why?  A few reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Emacs is my editor.  There are ways to interact with Jupyter with it, but it still comes clumsily to me.\n",
    "- I want to work with modules and multiple files; figuring out a way to do this with Jupyter is still a work in progress for me.  That goes double for using remote Jupyter, which at the moment is the cheapest way for me to use GPUs.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Anyhow, this was me backsliding a bit into Emacs and local development workflows.  (BTW, [this](https://ljvmiranda921.github.io/notebook/2020/03/16/jupyter-notebooks-in-2020-part-2/) is the best overview I've found so far of the tension between modules/files and notebooks.)\n",
    "\n",
    "However, this brings up larger questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- If I'm going to work in shared environments (Colab, Paperspace, Kaggle), notebooks are the way to go -- which makes working with modules in separate files a problem.  How can I work around that?  Should I be using detecto (or other wrappers) in order to make this easy?\n",
    " \n",
    "- How do I balance getting going quickly (detecto++) vs understanding the fundamentals?\n",
    "\n",
    "For now, here's what I'll be doing:\n",
    "\n",
    "- In this notebook, I'll focus on recreating my work with `src/pytorch/experiment.py` in a notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - **EDIT:** No, I'm not.  The work in `experiment.py` goes through [this tutorial](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/torchvision_tutorial.html).  That tutorial is fine, but it pulls in some non-exported libraries from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pytorch/vision/master/references/detection/engine.py -- which I broke out into separate directories in order to import.  This is a pain in the butt to put into a notebook...so! many! cells! that should be modules!\n",
    "  \n",
    "  I'm going to call this notebook to a halt.  Here's what I'm going to do next:\n",
    "\n",
    "- In my next notebook, I'll focus on training with Detecto again, now that the bug has been released.\n",
    "- And after _that_, I'm going to to give this task a try with [Pytorch Lightning Flash](https://github.com/PyTorchLightning/lightning-flash).\n",
    "\n",
    "And now, ~~on with the show~~ on to the next notebook."
